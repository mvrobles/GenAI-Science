"I want to write an article about: ""Common fairness definitions are mathematically incompatible."". Give me references that support the hypothesis related to that topic.","The assertion that ""Common fairness definitions are mathematically incompatible"" is well-supported in the field of algorithmic fairness, particularly within machine learning. This incompatibility often stems from ""impossibility theorems"" which demonstrate that it's often impossible to satisfy multiple intuitive fairness criteria simultaneously under real-world conditions.

Key references and concepts supporting this hypothesis include:

*   **Impossibility Theorems**
    *   A foundational result in algorithmic fairness states that it's generally impossible to simultaneously satisfy three common fairness definitions: demographic parity, equalized odds, and predictive rate parity, especially outside of special cases.
    *   This isn't an engineering failure but a mathematical certainty.
    *   Specifically, under practical conditions where the distribution of outcomes is unequal among protected classes, an algorithm cannot satisfy both sufficiency and separation simultaneously.

*   **Conflicting Fairness Definitions**
    *   **Demographic Parity (Statistical Parity):** Requires that the proportion of individuals receiving a positive outcome is the same across all groups.
    *   **Equalized Odds:** Demands that both true positive rates and false positive rates are the same across different groups.
    *   **Predictive Parity (Calibration):** Requires that the model be equally accurate for all groups, meaning the predicted probability of success is the same as the actual probability regardless of group.
    *   A model that satisfies demographic parity may violate equal opportunity, and vice versa.
    *   Multiple mathematical formulations of fairness exist, but they sometimes conflict with each other and diverge from social, economic, and legal understandings of justice.

*   **Fairness-Accuracy Trade-off**
    *   Research indicates a significant trade-off between fairness and predictive accuracy in machine learning models.
    *   Efforts to increase fairness by equalizing outcomes across populations may lead to a reduction in predictive accuracy.
    *   This is not solely a mathematical problem; it is also grounded in different understandings of what fairness truly means in a given context, implying that there is no single mathematical solution to resolve these conflicts.

*   **Individual vs. Group Fairness**
    *   Ensuring fairness requires addressing both group-level (Group Fairness - GF) and individual-level (Individual Fairness - IF) considerations.
    *   These notions capture complementary aspects of justice, but satisfying group-level criteria alone doesn't guarantee fair treatment of individuals. Conversely, individual fairness applied in isolation may perpetuate existing social inequalities.
    *   The debate around the COMPAS recidivism risk algorithm is a notable real-world example illustrating the conflict between different fairness metrics, such as separation and sufficiency.

These references collectively highlight that the mathematical formalization of fairness is complex, leading to inherent incompatibilities and necessary trade-offs when designing fair algorithmic systems.","['https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHqwbJsuPbadw73qTEiN01jemabT3o0hpKqhYrbUS5rfBxaZUGYkk892g3cjlVdmr0DeEeuu_RDMCfWP3atAMJWo-C_Gc_YQRPvvZxM_XNlokDwvan0Li7prAM0YCn7-QLbEIpej-0EfOyvjlnDaNDFw-ExfmoLDDosMP3sk5y6aRczUp85nHkH3eMUjuWAxJiY7HKkoELnoGWZGeDBMWaM-XXVkCSA', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGfF0TOLHQ88i5dO7xR8PXZsr9rahBsrHovK6AXjKyu4xVY2b3o3FMr16eIu9y5IbKAgbvy_hserWW7BNdDx1w6LeKXUMLjk-3D-HcQNplIpK0xl6iZcv-NK5k3', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG_w8b4QwS5zy8cc-yPhfZFq3cLT5_Iy8_KRhfKKUWr5KYXS0hGQdy40jCOWLpOFmdZsv11mSGHpqwLM6ASznkNxMQL__bUWUO8TI3bj3B81KhLFiN-t2KcYrF4ubVqxFAQihNQhnrzLKuNc__u9SiCM1Sw8QqC2RwkDa61iXYqAG1iffNoZVpIVNC5', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFQ6xMq6ZMj592UaVHgHtoRhThBO1wTVPWjR5xINzWikaJ1YGN2YWWrjl2d3zL91BwyWTznrlIl_HQRFxS_3dhw9SyiElKQmrPQL3ZjiXP0irP1bBuduwnPrKyFC7_9mr7QbG3VRZI1cZRwHB0NUJR8c0dqDXlAa5NYAqT_mHFy8y_2uvLvssfXtO0qPweYJ3hUBIiJrBpP49g=', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGNTxXAZRLbo4Sl4bUw4Wr-QnrJZM0qsD3oGtZpz-z-OVygf9u4Q2MNGcyF8MqEYuTfHSqb0RWin_Jn33-9VnGgli6DxntGyvIhQAI1Ww2sTyVgDnPwiQcRi-E9tvuc_K4lIr4IG6ssZbj68Hmd04dLF32PwAlM-2-_hue06-jEqc1g2Q5E8AHu2KqrU-PpqnAE9RbLONQKesax6IiK10--mdFJiz4khoKrVg7uEGARZuMWFQ==', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE_gs0aGphKhNj2l6mxp6UbN9bLfsBOrThBvU2CY9PYboqt5z3JacUh0SshqC79OrPSntplBANtY7E_iqk_sU6xB3dlRtddZ5MGU1hkNr4iL4u5RtNpMX-8NOY28QvUSAGu-wf6kiQM6-by6ZHYvkrn6QO3TgEWcfDtOxBma2lLn5RackPym0BGXLBh6XYFtsuaHMxG', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHyzBEo5_8VcE0pgvOHfthoP8sGI-5E1GC_-2y5vhEkFyvi2OxdM0jacEe3XKr5zQ4Ir-gKfkab8lpD4WUlzySba7xdsly3hN4P2yhDpSCqmqDrNb0XQAO_deYmhaBfG2CcE5umlnTkklP8Og57', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEDK6s-MRzH2qF2ujCDO2TsI0GuS1zsL7OYr3OEWRexHqvtZW7Rfx_2PgRNeZpAb9U34TfLipy2lbVG5IQz7iNkZfl3u-FWC7Ivz0WwU9h2Lilt-nC570grg-YUOLI9Ns-nDMZn7_vyYG2jlget2rf9VlbwxqW7ZQ==', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEtR8ZDJooHInEdOXu72o4TUFnzl_ypPm99DtxdODNIk-Cun0JchdaA3vBSZZFa3B3HMbkCc2wRf42kNgyRXzFKvK61x9XQ4IW5nHwu6gUylozXNlyOS3XlpdnsJs_Na4HZvZJuRc4TSZ7Ju-ifiIGb67MKx_94Cba91nMMqF3IzIWJYS0yEK9-vi_lg8hTP-H0aDu4xg==', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEIGLHewcKgs4zh3ke9rBI8ucaO8S4U5qq-j_QCcJbua35yW9i6C7WPmRK-r3IQY5KLnAUhAi498p6XM1WmPRXRCASrWZZOC7TTZ7wgAITZGHJx-mkSTiYSbr37', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG6dRGrLQhMBfjRmyE8ZA80w-HminHkBwSDVA5BvOnXLQjI8TxYibgOq8_oACXLoYn3utWzoQEyL-Eu6XTLr2zL15FC3BhTA_dHwCHMcnYoDxlrJ7hgUi7aJtqfmgrO7qPnleu66hv8UolnOyZ0sDR42ptH6PYB6_6DnkYzc3USZseA7J8U7X4=', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQH6rDV_5zlG-jplLRp5TUnVCa1QPA7_NqBZjWKifTeMYHUawDKC_gYU62kCr2pHwv5toLlAsiSKtqYxwfc4kbJiuytRV9x8FR2Sr31IRaBSTLsq8-BBcpUBTatP4tUFwRbTdBEtU7UY-tdRjvUtV-xh0P9Gh_iFivWVqUByHnxvSXnQ6uaoYFzgxDNxDa1X1T5Biq2GFWWEEwjMfyw=', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQF1acW3avVM7PT-71rr6og93gps6oWZ9aglHo6cLhzM7tktqAsbAX2WmV2_R2D8aGPOrk5luloUmQTfSbotLf-yP3o4xZK1ovfAfn3__VTbiWQ_ei9MoVR-lRrOx59dkWMWQ98u-0NCpxqHPpqdoH0wqKW5PaL9nwkuoBrBZTCMFQ==', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGLKPuwFEGWWdCCZEvBBA0UaKlkjYgTY9kqe9ouIGOFMAc0AAoZrmMU-LKhBYIxpk08FHGEoKJktyCmlNVMBAjmZ9WjRCb8D_wvs2F9BmOOk1u9FMYrBMDj0e6EY6rmirlQrLE5lVq39CrirdAwAaU5u3jPHitlTe6AIFACy5Gw8-e5', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGUVIwN3V2SbVjigp99XSJfmAPE1UyocwFuYQ7eYOB-_NvvyTfa_nXIatZfuz2LMnDD-FDGkld-VaFUZDZz_XgeTz6VySxk4LuhnytFPkN4io5_k0ACSvF0BbnwM69_']",
"I want to write an article about: ""Machine Learning models can be biased even without using protected attributes. Seeamingly neutral features can act as proxies for protected variables such as race, gender, class, etc."". Give me references that support the hypothesis related to that topic.","Machine learning models can indeed exhibit bias even when protected attributes like race, gender, or class are not explicitly used. This phenomenon, often referred to as ""proxy discrimination"" or ""indirect bias,"" occurs because seemingly neutral features can act as proxies for these sensitive variables, leading to discriminatory outcomes.

Here are references that support this hypothesis:

*   **Proxy Discrimination Defined:** Proxy discrimination occurs when neutral features in an AI system implicitly encode protected attributes, leading to unfair outcomes. This can happen even if a firm unintentionally discriminates, as models may find that a facially neutral practice produces desirable outcomes due to its correlation with a protected class. This form of bias is considered a particularly ""pernicious"" subset of disparate impact, where a neutral practice disproportionately harms members of a protected class.
*   **Neutral Features as Proxies:** Many AI systems that avoid using demographic features like gender or race can still produce discriminatory results due to the presence of proxy variables. These are variables that encode a protected attribute with substantial accuracy. For instance, a model using zip codes or addresses can indirectly make decisions based on race, as these geographical indicators often correlate with racial demographics and socioeconomic status. Other examples of features that can act as proxies include purchasing habits, family medical history, or even seemingly innocuous data points like years since graduation, which can serve as a proxy for age.
*   **Mechanism of Indirect Bias:** Bias can be embedded in machine learning if the AI is trained on data that reflects human or societal prejudices. Models can infer information about protected attributes through these proxies, even if those attributes are not explicitly provided as inputs. The bias is not tied to a single parameter but is distributed across the data-generating process and the relationships among variables. This can lead to models perpetuating existing stereotypes and reinforcing social biases.
*   **Real-World Implications and Challenges:** The impact of these biases can be significant, leading to discrimination in various high-stakes domains such as finance, healthcare, employment, and criminal justice. For example, a healthcare algorithm that uses spending as a proxy for need might disproportionately disadvantage certain racial groups if those groups historically had less access to care and thus lower spending. Detecting and mitigating this indirect bias is challenging because the links between proxy features and protected attributes may not always be clear to humans.","['https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGvNgnb7L2ARqwyKKIofEteNQ6MVbmz_6BP2W5RWN0E4L58gH4zw6QP1nozeVYoodfczfrYbTfRGYGbNCznYGhO9W5GP5o25Lbu_FN7D2m9D4tqX0Yy9Nb0LZaKCoQ=', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQErhXVIg3nWq50kvoUUVvC8Z3VJbFYT3515fl-KJmCHdIYPaihdLYwaO___nTMI0kCi0P6DXQEh1bB3YhyHimyScixLjmCPaKHYnMExNIyUPq3I7gKn_-w4osKzo03Fyy8pmWBy3-Uc65LocuRlratOt3S3Yo745HsmIDGnYX9yt7PwfTvtTW9lFMpZxOg7sR-uwEuu71-1N3A-h1xTMw5TQPLvybAPL-I7QKZZtENB6JeejYc=', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHOH07M8eve86xeC09WqmeJvpaG5l0fUrFV4rwgDX6nW7oxN7xlpzQYLT9qYrpe603qMf8lK4cOEbu13-LpNp-TVBNhC_6sAb_Kn9JBnTK22ibpUXtRjRdI3ujF-xcbveyayC9D6elLZotJoB0lJRf0KVDRorU5D7uPArrcgzL3-kwzLUTJ2sLA2O3Avd05F-sLXQdUZiGPYg==', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHtssE64oDPl1cgD0BSOfAdEnN284naDLo0xZzyMS19maQfpfX2vVuFUGjPtFUmFt4xzkUDRAg_-u0D2oP7dYKt6FkrZjp5AMI8CkdnAESo0fF8Xu45UdMmmxnP2wdWYfRW8nHF2cGf5npCK2TirJuPKH0=', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHX_U_vxXVVwp35bfNom0qiJIsEBAG20NbHROr1QhANSSqFnj82zG8JDPSLKcx1NYEf5QK8qGx5hKf_Zn0gMH_PM4J5qi4KHD4FwRwiVHvjfuEY7k6Rdn77tZMDzIw5UzpsR5UY-DDbRMRJHA_p0GwOeVO48rDgI_THCmbgCAMado15bkUKTyy7Cw==', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQH44VzA6LpZzlF6gL2LV9XFN2aatlnFJlwCRNTeftFBiEI_qnOfYVA0Yo7scezqfEWMplWrYZoRPSN7s-EiwqaLqkANrM9OKEL0WiAfruxmzW6tmSbSpyAylUkAlrxLzBTSPsQ3Yu0jJMwzR9qSO8ZmMkxnrBw5nM6a-htRgfytmaKTKuwYWPwtp4Cjew8UF1X-yCC0rkfIQGZBmj2MjmqCveApF6oFEgRdyJswUl1vEjRuM9qxWaTv_N2zVIt7', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGJwb82HBUbgTCQKstk7aYvg9t0axYfS5RwpeXZ6gSNImV8ETAlIOv5ExKqgk5sZ0ALJhwaLDIDmqKP-DPD49q9f7PzhHjHbgBfi46CzhD5nuWtlpkTNsggiNBaJDGVJ6hcX2F8jWwhlw==', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGVaWsQ_pkGTn7abVkrNigsXnrIG4-twNvdQ-WEomTgQkbZVF0CvwUTMNnPx-8aKf0zfj3OBPvpt9h-2qAuCnf80UW3SDg5rIrJBwTCervXGG35od47hkE-StgPQkAhREUO1Jo2PnB7uhjyNNW_X3hYu9P-zROrxPnYGzV5WlU25Gvn', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGzxt_yLHkVI2tLHglmOGxF39tyTqdD8_yxF7fzrqP1Qc9H08hfTeayJmr0aDdv4e9JaXgbs8xg1DNKfiKxGivXo3hbKdC3btGpAiEHo91GHSMAQkk5V5K8vohVvOme5TnRLxQchUvmaxE9wjsFXo6-jTZpLU9sfsY6SEdiDyBbkEri6WHP7QSkffcpvWmsTiz_jUTMKVdXp8Hn_t8I_nw=', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGRw-G6riYqzq1fgH2DmXfmGpDj2--aQnGlCjaC-Zf0HLBnbLZx1oqdCADtbt2Qe4Wj8LUE367DQFYb0TH-5CadDHS2fyCPLlrbPlyBQJXlxNKbDSslhEBD43fMAYOFBohJHxHje8MeYefHy96X4B5KOD9kNksDCtmvRF824HLFB70h_blpLdI23DhI279tZw==', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFWgb4HTJGlJqiUlE8MdyoHJoxJsrm96qLgYdV-22nuAPJRH32y-Au4Iak8v-AAO2JKg6lmut43pCJpMJeEyA5t0ULESFqKFsvGZkWhgRnJL1fz_kaZi2_fZV5fVgkxZy_ABaCDbQ==', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQH2T49ObQkwFNAzWsYe-ErUlPGU_AWh6Z-JT6TOXiqpB_9xXE327-3z-GsTjXP4HC2Z9uPlZtI6YlFJ1sb12jTBvJv1Z3ryD2H5miYGSuVCcsyMzbQbdZ5wxtKk2W1uXWmMUHpGQVxwVyeL9wFTLkGtaBQal3ouIyLy', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFZLc5lLbI5GD3NrdxXNQ4dyigG1UK5N3En4Co1I2Ol0mpmZ6Z1AKzuRTTerLIc7j8DsRhAHNNt5AkhZDRt-sEwDNICs8GeJuZi-PueAnyIVDbyeFnX_HS-BeFHO1hIr6eIbQf4xb_xH66elm_8V15VabPD370YpfTOVjYC9nI0ebFDD2eEGc3BPEsw530=', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGKUT2PIMDcZwSVw3-Ah5sYXplI6Kt7bCJLlNnrPdE11FwopS5_YV6MtAv84-r7CKA-vzAH0_bU7P5fJQluEsvYJ3Kg-YHbvhzXR2YdFeq9O8LpJ8SjwSJb9tbR1mPx', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGYn55r_n4ccFWOl8ZVFqhztq6x1ltWMKGH2KPffPDnaeSaGsaqvlkOU2cDZSlPVsERF-W5j5kmp3oXijYlKZMiNkXDgXP0tLYz_LAaaPgqCyZD7A2DhB1hYehKkqn2Daw5ea1QcMvPJNTTgTfqYQPkrd7SoVu6Ov7ZJwwoLEASjq9wZLfDFdPiLzansji8olGU']",
"I want to write an article about: ""Evaluation and mitigation efforts that define “fairness” only in terms of a model’s inputs/outputs can be misleading Fairness-related failures can come from the surrounding sociotechnical context."". Give me references that support the hypothesis related to that topic.","Evaluating and mitigating fairness in AI solely through a model's inputs and outputs can be misleading, as fairness-related failures often stem from the broader sociotechnical context in which these systems operate. Numerous references support this hypothesis, highlighting the limitations of purely technical approaches and advocating for a more holistic perspective.

Key references and supporting arguments include:

*   **Context-Dependent Nature of Fairness:** The very definition of ""fairness"" is not universal and is heavily dependent on the specific sociotechnical context in which an AI system is deployed. Different use cases may require different notions of fairness (e.g., distributive, procedural, group, individual, or causal fairness), making a single, input/output-centric definition inadequate.
*   **Insufficiency of Technical Solutions:** Purely technical solutions for mitigating bias are often insufficient to ensure equitable AI deployment in real-world sociocultural contexts. Relying solely on algorithmic interventions overlooks the complex interplay of social and technical elements.
*   **Sociotechnical Blind Spots:** Addressing AI fairness solely through mathematical abstractions can create ""sociotechnical blind spots,"" where crucial contextual factors are ignored. This limited view can prevent a comprehensive understanding and effective mitigation of bias.
*   **Bias Beyond Algorithms and Data:** Bias in AI is not merely a technical flaw within the algorithm or the training data, but rather an emergent property arising from the interaction of algorithmic processes, institutional structures, and societal norms. Fairness failures can be introduced at various stages of an AI system's lifecycle, from data collection and labeling to model training, development, and deployment, often influenced by human biases.
*   **Systemic Nature of AI Fairness:** AI fairness is a systemic issue that intersects with information governance, communication, and ethics. It reflects deeper societal questions about power, who builds AI, whose interests are served, and who is accountable when failures occur. For instance, historical inequalities embedded in data can be amplified by AI systems if not considered within their broader social context.
*   **The Need for Interdisciplinary Approaches:** Achieving more effective bias mitigation and fairer AI systems requires a comprehensive sociotechnical framework that integrates technical expertise with social science insights, human oversight, regulatory frameworks, and diverse stakeholder engagement. This collaborative approach moves beyond isolated technical fixes to address systemic biases and discrimination. Timnit Gebru also emphasizes that ""we can't ignore social and structural problems"" when addressing bias in AI, advocating for an understanding of how AI systems are used, who benefits, and who is unfairly targeted.","['https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHJD4FTVXedHf1sB2RxAlli1zVPMrSWg2wDCh5h-qOjRy8kprRoQace-vNguPhDWBCUCaWlU3A7elp0gzu01j2nD3_JPs9oqCFDToNhkJS9WWGorYgGa3MjOo1e6XpNusEk8AFOTrBfNCt_3vOiNolotOmaLLyTAi3pJHJWY4NIwOFaemlG0R0=', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHvdh29iTfjLsxKx38KOPmmIsrWezINw2sWcMYr89eY-5sfpGtzJkoFVk1qwnnUNTdkP-_dIavPtXiwGSnP07MraBzXeBM3faL104JCjOoZByF7_lNKg0x3OngdC8PetZYSrvTQSALF3uN2mZvTxLiKh0fzSK3Ub5ch0fNgWqU_Fb-MW7D83fqYV_gPNNCVbWt1GPaTOYJ64AdWk7Wv8UaeO5ZxmL-Ao1TmMl6Oem3NeA==', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHs599rFcfuNpWhBJA9aZcZ2vLTvbXaaDiPqsiS84yK0AAhM2RMcjYuef9kKdH5WWxLXVTAsNGrtMCkuyJwTV0AwIjXF7HPXShpObaF0pao4oss1PdHJ1FaUyTg7htNmxZ0nUrOijzue6AcfLPdlP3M1A4WMST33bsiUP0almcU3sibh8kZE1sxfsHMX-ptjNd70m3wc5408TuR3x7yDexsVAJprmicCEgU-dxKBPvc7bqdeu7S-vL_bDUhAEGSVVkscuLHKD3mptlYGGtx7EO9wLE=', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQF3l8_uUEM0vwrgQ65YGU9Xf-5EcvepHxdemde9roTQHgSZCXs87rFk--BgGinf1sQOFrjhDMIhuLMTzcFeYxTQAhMELn55EZziI6IFNBKBQx8t8irUA9wtejlflGWBftn737AZuf48VtdZo_iJ3aTYUECaseofjISB8avAyCclGKt6j9FfxX1VSuzVolDSD7nTaUd1TI-yvhR-7_tOZQYt_xcHXn1erHxR7w==', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQExRIBjpeSfdJhPXsF56CRgIXBcnn2r9ZqD62pxQVlowgsBwZhxUq6An5ul-_JZIKW3W4jAi-cVUS2DFiRF1MSyJjFdXA-tZsu7eoO9TnPBB0-W8VS0S3rTSIst', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGww9tDv7_La4w_exCH-4pmi_PGnUsG_YuqNPSizbR5hbrVFnSVttQ5l91PM_dQHW8ZOhPYMbMoG-aTqDww_gJmc2WB5cAKe5op2ZabrnfOtlss1f5ZWfEvygv7A4yE4YwMSSGG19P7Ov9CawZ8J0EJjOOH5EA=', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQH_YeveX9NtMc7RcHDsPUfM7Lhcn_J0Y3ChWR2BLkTPJXDPNn1BL2VY0PXczZPXkzHp6Q_2QmmWaew_pjSjNd6XL209IQ74vr4gPwvuNX49mtYTytMtHP7j2NF-v38t3RVIi0PR1mMa1wgcjO1l', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGpGEudN6Q59V1RHtBMAun025q87SyfrRf-DZ7l8Chii22ukWvmOydOPBtvUeAMxh22s7-ZaG7sOwyF2-JgZrh34WbuKmpg0S6oVO3CTMgQthntdvW6LiJ--5i2q_xGGo8k-R2mHw0F62xcNkg0W0VPtQ3JFTvqfMsFwpYAS-MgGnGmR-7kz1tkkp7daLW1dBhzXdEsEjMcGx5_IA==', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGEFo-JVIlGC9qtuClzpp0yXxVkrXKj6NtEwQ4In4ZNXlmoWzYG-Pxo5hGeMzfB0zBXB1y_MnhPRwZ5kH6YnOS6C4Ku9hUAxKLItUMM2R-HjC6xMCejyjbqSRmSQmXHciaWhutyJW0=']",
