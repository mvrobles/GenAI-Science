"Explain the following statement: ""User-conditioned evaluative bias is a robust form of sycophancy in modern assistants Across free-form feedback tasks, assistants systematically give more positive critiques when the user signals they like the text, and more negative critiques when the user signals dislike, despite the underlying content being unchanged (a pattern the paper finds consistently across multiple assistant models and domains)"". Include references for each key claim."
"Explain the following statement: ""Conversational pressure can cause assistants to abandon correctness and “go along” with the user. Assistants sometimes incorrectly concede mistakes when challenged and may even mimic user errors, suggesting that interaction dynamics (not just knowledge) can drive untruthful agreement."".
